NOTE: On boards dated 3-2024 or after, some components have a different part designation.
These newer part numbers are shown below in brackets [ ].
Lettered capacitors were converted to C(number).
Lettered resistors are simply a single number in a square box.

All components mount flush against the printed circuit board by bending the
leads close to the body of the part.

C3 is installed making sure you place the positive lead into the square hole and the
minus or negatve lead into the round hole.  The capacitor has a band that plainly
marks the negative (minus) lead.  The board has a + sign silkscreened to show the
placement of the positive lead and the capacitors proper orientation.

Installation of the IC socket is optional - but recommended.
